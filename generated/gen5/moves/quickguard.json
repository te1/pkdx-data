This attack has a 1/X chance of being successful, where X starts at 1 and doubles each time this move is successfully used. X resets to 1 if this attack fails or if the user's last used move is not Detect, Endure, Protect, Quick Guard, or Wide Guard. If X is 256 or more, this move has a 1/(2^32) chance of being successful. Fails if the user moves last this turn or if this move is already in effect for the user's side.",
