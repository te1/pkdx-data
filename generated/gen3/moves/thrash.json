  "desc": "The user spends two or three turns locked into this move and becomes confused at the end of the last turn of the effect if it is not already. This move targets an opposing Pokemon at random on each turn. If the user is prevented from moving, falls asleep, becomes frozen, or the attack is not successful against the target, the effect ends without causing confusion. If this move is called by Sleep Talk, the move is used for one turn and does not confuse the user.",
