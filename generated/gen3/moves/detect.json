  "desc": "The user is protected from most attacks made by other Pokemon during this turn. This move has an X/65536 chance of being successful, where X starts at 65535 and halves, rounded down, each time this move is successfully used. After the fourth successful use in a row, X drops to 118 and continues with seemingly random values from 0-65535 on subsequent successful uses. X resets to 65535 if this move fails or if the user's last move used is not Detect, Endure, or Protect. Fails if the user moves last this turn.",
