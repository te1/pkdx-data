However, if one or more adjacent Pokemon has the Ability \"No Ability\", Trace won't copy anything even if there is another valid Ability it could normally copy. Otherwise, if there is no Ability that can be copied at that time, this Ability will activate as soon as an Ability can be copied. Abilities that cannot be copied are the previously mentioned \"No Ability\", as well as Battle Bond, Comatose, Disguise, Flower Gift, Forecast, Illusion, Imposter, Multitype, Power Construct, Power of Alchemy, Receiver, RKS System, Schooling, Shields Down, Stance Change, Trace, and Zen Mode.",
