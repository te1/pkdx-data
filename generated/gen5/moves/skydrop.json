  "desc": "This attack takes the target into the air with the user on the first turn and executes on the second. On the first turn, the user and the target avoid all attacks other than Gust, Hurricane, Sky Uppercut, Smack Down, Thunder, and Twister. The user and the target cannot make a move between turns, but the target can select a move to use. This move cannot damage Flying-type Pokemon. Fails on the first turn if the target is an ally, if the target has a substitute, or if the target is using Bounce, Dig, Dive, Fly, Shadow Force, or Sky Drop. If the effect of Gravity ends this effect before the second turn, both the user and the target return to the ground, but the target will otherwise remain under this effect until the user leaves the field or successfully executes the second turn of any two-turn move.",
