  "desc": "Deals typeless damage. Hits one time for the user and one time for each unfainted Pokemon without a non-volatile status condition in the user's party. For each hit, the damage formula uses the participating Pokemon's base Attack as the Attack stat, the target's base Defense as the Defense stat, and ignores stat stages and other effects that modify Attack or Defense; each hit is considered to come from the user.",
