During the effect, the power of Dragon-type attacks used against grounded Pokemon is multiplied by 0.5 and grounded Pokemon cannot be inflicted with a non-volatile status condition. Grounded Pokemon can become affected by Yawn but cannot fall asleep from its effect. Camouflage transforms the user into a Fairy type, Nature Power becomes Moonblast, and Secret Power has a 30% chance to lower Special Attack by 1 stage. Fails if the current terrain is Misty Terrain.",
