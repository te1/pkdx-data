If this Pokemon is not the target of a single-target Electric-type move used by another Pokemon, this Pokemon redirects that move to itself if it is within the range of that move. If multiple Pokemon could redirect with this Ability, it goes to the one with the highest Speed, or in the case of a tie to the one that has had this Ability active longer.",
