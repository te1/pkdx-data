  "desc": "For 0 to 7 turns, one of the target's known moves that has at least 1 PP remaining becomes disabled, at random. Fails if one of the target's moves is already disabled, or if none of the target's moves have PP remaining. If any Pokemon uses Haze, this effect ends. Whether or not this move was successful, it counts as a hit for the purposes of the opponent's use of Rage.",
