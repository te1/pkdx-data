If that opposing Pokemon's position is no longer in use and there is another opposing Pokemon on the field, the damage is done to it instead. This move considers Hidden Power as Normal type, and only the last hit of a multi-hit attack is counted. Fails if the user was not hit by an opposing Pokemon's special attack this turn, or if the user did not lose HP from the attack.",
