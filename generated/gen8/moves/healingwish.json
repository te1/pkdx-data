  "desc": "The user faints, and if the Pokemon brought out to replace it does not have full HP or has a non-volatile status condition, its HP is fully restored along with having any non-volatile status condition cured. The replacement is sent out at the end of the turn, and the healing happens before hazards take effect. This effect continues until a Pokemon that meets either of these conditions switches in at the user's position or gets swapped into the position with Ally Switch. Fails if the user is the last unfainted Pokemon in its party.",
