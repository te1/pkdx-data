If the target is an opponent and its side is protected by Quick Guard or Wide Guard, that protection is also broken for this turn and other Pokemon may attack the opponent's side normally. This attack charges on the first turn and executes on the second. On the first turn, the user avoids all attacks. If the user is holding a Power Herb, the move completes in one turn.",
