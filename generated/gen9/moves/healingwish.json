The replacement is sent out at the end of the turn, and the healing happens before hazards take effect. This effect continues until a Pokemon that meets either of these conditions switches in at the user's position or gets swapped into the position with Ally Switch. Fails if the user is the last unfainted Pokemon in its party.",
