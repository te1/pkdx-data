If this move hits a target under the effect of Bounce, Fly, Magnet Rise, or Telekinesis, the effect ends. If the target is a Flying type that has not used Roost this turn or a Pokemon with the Levitate Ability, it loses its immunity to Ground-type attacks and the Arena Trap Ability as long as it remains active. During the effect, Magnet Rise fails for the target and Telekinesis fails against the target.",
