  "desc": "The user is unaffected by certain non-damaging moves directed at it and will instead use such moves against the original user. If the move targets both opposing Pokemon and the Pokemon under this effect is on the left side, it will reflect the move targeting both opposing Pokemon and its ally will not be affected by the original move; otherwise, if the Pokemon under this effect is on the right side, its ally will be affected by the original move and this Pokemon will reflect the move only targeting the original user. The effect ends once a move is reflected or at the end of the turn. Moves reflected in this way can be reflected again by another Pokemon under this effect. If the user has the Soundproof Ability, it nullifies sound-based moves before this effect happens. The Lightning Rod Ability redirects Electric moves before this move takes effect.",
